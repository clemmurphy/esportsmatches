# Fnatic Match Tracker

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/c4hWznfM-tI

A simple table that shows all upcoming Fnatic esports matches across League of Legends, Valorant, CSGO, Rainbow 6 and Dota 2.

Users can customise which titles they want to see on registration, and update their account settings accordingly.

## Why is this useful?

As a fan of Fnatic, I want to see when and where all of the teams are playing in one place. Because titles and communities are often segregated, it means I often need to check five or six different sites to be able to see when and where teams are playing.

## What technology did I use?

The server is built on Python, with Flask being the framework for routing HTTP requests and displaying responsive content. There is some JavaScript in there as well for front-end sorting, and I used Bootstrap as my front end HTML library.

I used SQLite for the database, and the Pandascore API to be able to get live match data.

## Why make this?

I made this as my final project for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course.
